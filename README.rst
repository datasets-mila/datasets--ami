The AMI Meeting Corpus is a multi-modal data set consisting of 100 hours of
meeting recordings. For a gentle introduction to the corpus, see the `corpus
overview <http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/ami/corpus/overview.shtml>`_. To access
the data, follow the directions given `there
<http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/ami/download>`_. Around two-thirds of the data has
been elicited using a scenario in which the participants play different roles
in a design team, taking a design project from kick-off to completion over the
course of a day. The rest consists of naturally occurring meetings in a range
of domains. Detailed information can be found in the documentation section.
